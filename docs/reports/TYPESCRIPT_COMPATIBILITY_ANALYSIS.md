# Cap'n Web TypeScript Compatibility Analysis

## Test Results Summary

After running the official TypeScript batch-pipelining example against our Rust server implementation, we've identified a critical capability addressing issue that needs to be resolved.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Capability Addressing Mismatch

**Problem**: The TypeScript client expects `import_id=0` to map to the default API capability with methods like `authenticate`, `getUserProfile`, and `getNotifications`. However, the Rust server is mapping `import_id=0` to `CapId(1)` which contains the Calculator capability.

**Evidence from server logs**:
```
[DEBUG] Mapped import_id 0 to capability CapId(1)
[INFO] Calling method 'authenticate' on capability CapId(1)
[DEBUG] Calculator::authenticate called with args: [String("cookie-123")]
[ERROR] Method 'authenticate' not found on Calculator
```

**Root Cause**: The server's capability mapping logic appears to be using `import_id + 1` instead of directly mapping `import_id` to the corresponding `CapId`.

### 2. Wire Protocol Compatibility

**Success**: The Rust server successfully parses the Cap'n Web wire protocol messages:
- ✅ Correctly handles `push` messages
- ✅ Correctly handles `pull` messages
- ✅ Correctly parses pipeline expressions
- ✅ Generates proper error responses

**Evidence**:
```
Successfully parsed 6 messages from wire batch:
- Push(Pipeline { import_id: 0, property_path: Some([String("authenticate")]), args: Some(Array([String("cookie-123")])) })
- Push(Pipeline { import_id: 0, property_path: Some([String("getUserProfile")]), ... })
- Push(Pipeline { import_id: 0, property_path: Some([String("getNotifications")]), ... })
- Pull(1), Pull(2), Pull(3)
```

### 3. Pipeline Expression Support

**Partial Success**: The server recognizes pipeline expressions but doesn't fully evaluate them:
```
[WARN] Unsupported WireExpression type: Pipeline { import_id: 1, property_path: Some([String("id")]), args: None }
```

This indicates that while the parser understands the pipeline syntax, the executor doesn't yet handle dependent pipeline evaluations.

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Capability Mapping
The server needs to map `import_id=0` directly to `CapId(0)` where the Api capability is registered. The current mapping appears to be:
- `import_id=0` → `CapId(1)` (Calculator) ❌
- Should be: `import_id=0` → `CapId(0)` (Api) ✅

### Fix 2: Default Capability Convention
TypeScript Cap'n Web assumes the default capability (accessed via `import_id=0`) is the main API. Our server should follow this convention by registering the primary API at `CapId(0)`.

### Fix 3: Pipeline Expression Evaluation
The server needs to fully implement pipeline expression evaluation to handle dependent calls like:
```javascript
api.getUserProfile(user.id)  // Pipeline expression accessing 'id' from previous result
```

## Protocol Compatibility Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Wire Protocol Parsing | ✅ Working | Correctly parses push/pull messages |
| Message Serialization | ✅ Working | Generates proper wire format responses |
| Error Handling | ✅ Working | Returns proper error codes and messages |
| Capability Addressing | ❌ Broken | Incorrect import_id to CapId mapping |
| Pipeline Evaluation | ⚠️ Partial | Parses but doesn't evaluate pipelines |
| Promise Pipelining | ⚠️ Untested | Blocked by capability addressing issue |

## Test Output Analysis

### TypeScript Client Request
The client sends a properly formatted batch request with pipeline expressions:
```
["push",["pipeline",0,["authenticate"],["cookie-123"]]]
["push",["pipeline",0,["getUserProfile"],[["pipeline",1,["id"]]]]]
["push",["pipeline",0,["getNotifications"],[["pipeline",1,["id"]]]]]
["pull",1]
["pull",2]
["pull",3]
```

### Rust Server Response
The server returns error messages for all calls due to the capability mismatch:
```
["reject",1,["error","not_found","Method 'authenticate' not found on Calculator"]]
["reject",2,["error","not_found","Method 'getUserProfile' not found on Calculator"]]
["reject",3,["error","not_found","Method 'getNotifications' not found on Calculator"]]
```

## Conclusion

The Rust Cap'n Web implementation has successfully implemented the wire protocol format and message parsing. However, there's a critical issue with capability addressing that prevents the TypeScript examples from running correctly. Once the capability mapping is fixed (changing the mapping from `import_id + 1` to direct `import_id` mapping), the TypeScript examples should work correctly with the Rust server.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fix**: Update the capability mapping logic in the server to correctly map `import_id=0` to `CapId(0)`
2. **Pipeline Support**: Implement full pipeline expression evaluation for dependent calls
3. **Re-test**: Run the TypeScript examples again after fixes
4. **Validation**: Run the complete test suite to ensure full compatibility

The good news is that the core protocol implementation is solid - we just need to fix the capability addressing convention to match what TypeScript clients expect.
